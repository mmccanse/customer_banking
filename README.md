# customer_banking

The 'customer_banking.py' file contains the main code. This file calls functions from the 'savings_account.py' and 'cd_account.py' files.  The account class is housed in the 'Account.py' file.

This code prompts the user to enter account balance, interest rate, and number of months to maturity for both a savings account and a CD account. The code then returns the amount of interest earned and the updated account balances for each.

In completing this assignment, I referred to Zoom recordings of the module 3 class sessions, previous class exercises, and I used a teaching assistant prompt provided by the instructor which is crafted to assist in troubleshooting issues and providing support and guidance in writing code without giving answers.
